# 🐙 GithubManager

A personal GitHub social management desktop application built in **C# WinForms (.NET 10)** using the official [Octokit.net](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net) library. Built for power users who want full control over their GitHub social presence without touching the browser.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Overview
- Live follower and following counts
- API rate limit monitoring
- One-click token swap without restarting the app

### 🔄 Follow Diff
- Side-by-side view of who doesn't follow you back vs who you haven't followed back yet
- Sortable **Following Since** column — click to sort by days, see who's been ignoring you longest
- Bulk follow and unfollow with throttled, rate-limit-safe execution
- **Keep List** — permanently protect accounts from ever appearing in your unfollow list
- **Never Follow List** — blacklist accounts the crawler will always skip; auto-unfollows on add; import from `.txt` file
- Deduplication — no duplicate entries across paginated API results
- Full operation log with cancel support

### 🤖 Follow Crawler
- Pull candidate followers from any target GitHub user
- Choose between their **followers** or **who they follow** as your candidate source
- **Target Validation** — preview any account before pulling:
  - Profile photo, follower/following counts, public repo count
  - Follow ratio, account age
  - Color-coded quality assessment (Excellent / Good / Decent / Poor)
- **Quality Filter** — skip accounts with too few repos or bot-like follow ratios
- Live streaming candidate queue — candidates appear as pages load
- Randomized interval timer with countdown to next follow action
- Configurable daily cap
- Never Follow list checked before queuing — prevents re-following blacklisted accounts
- Export candidate queue and follow log to file

### ⚡ Auto Follow-Back
- Polls your followers on a configurable interval
- Automatically follows back anyone who followed you that you haven't followed yet
- Run Once Now for immediate execution
- Full timestamped action log

### ⭐ Star-Back
- Scans your followers' public repositories
- Deduplicates against your existing starred repos
- Configurable minimum star threshold and follower scan count
- Capped at top 100 repos per user — prevents slowdowns on large accounts
- Cancel mid-scan — partial results still populate
- Select All + bulk star in one click

### 🏥 Repo Health Scanner
- Scans all your public repositories and checks for:
  - ✔ README present
  - ✔ Description set
  - ✔ Topics tagged
  - ✔ Homepage URL
  - ✔ Recent activity (flags repos stale for 6+ months)
- Color-coded health rating per repo (Good / Okay / Poor)
- **Quick Fix Topics** — set topics on any repo directly from the app
- Open any repo in browser with one click

### 🏆 Achievements Tracker

## 🔧 Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- [.NET 10 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- Visual Studio 2022+ (for building from source)
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

---

## 🔑 GitHub Token Setup

Requires a **Classic Personal Access Token** with:

| Scope | Required For |
|---|---|
| `user:follow` | Follow / Unfollow operations |
| `public_repo` | Starring repositories |
| `read:user` | Profile and achievement data |

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Check: `user:follow`, `public_repo`, `read:user`
4. Copy the token — shown once only

> ⚠️ Fine-grained tokens handle starring differently. Classic tokens recommended for full compatibility.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaccoonFacts/GithubManager.git
cd GithubManager
```

1. Open `GithubManager.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. **Manage NuGet Packages** → install:
   - `Octokit`
   - `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`
3. Build → Run (`F5`)
4. Enter your PAT on first launch — check **Remember Token** to encrypt and persist it

---

## 🔒 Security

- Token encrypted via **Windows DPAPI** (`ProtectedData.Protect`), tied to your Windows user account
- Stored at `%AppData%\GithubManager\token.enc` — never plain text
- All persistent data stays local, only outbound connection is the official GitHub API
